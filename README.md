
Here's a README file describing your bakery order notification template application developed using Python's tkinter module:

Bakery Order Notification Template
This application is a simple Python script that utilizes the tkinter GUI toolkit to help bakery businesses generate personalized order notification messages based on a user-defined template. The application allows the user to input a template and fill in specific details like customer name, time of order, and additional details to produce a formatted message that can be used for notifying customers.

Features
Template Customization: Users can enter and save a custom message template with placeholders for customer name, time, and details.
Dynamic Message Generation: Generates personalized messages by replacing placeholders in the template with user input.
User-friendly Interface: Provides a simple and intuitive graphical user interface for easy operation.

Before you run the application, you need to ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the tkinter module. The tkinter module is included with most Python installations, but if it's not available, you can install it based on your Python version and operating system.

No additional installation is required if Python and tkinter are already installed. Just run the script directly.
